# Multi-Stream Livestreaming Implementation Summary

## What Was Accomplished ✅

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- ✅ Applied migration to both local and production databases
- ✅ Renamed `livestreams` → `broadcast_sessions` for clarity
- ✅ Added `broadcast_streams` table for individual streams
- ✅ Added `viewer_preferences` for layout customization
- ✅ Added dynamic pricing calculation function

### 2. Backend API Updates
- ✅ Fixed CORS configuration in Kubernetes ConfigMap
- ✅ Maintained backward compatibility with legacy endpoints
- ✅ Added new multi-stream endpoints:
  - `/api/v1/livestream/session/start` - Start multi-stream session
  - `/api/v1/livestream/session/{id}/status` - Get session status
  - `/api/v1/livestream/session/{id}/join` - Join as viewer
  - `/api/v1/livestream/session/{id}/preferences` - Viewer layout preferences
  - `/api/v1/livestream/stream/{id}/signal/*` - Per-stream WebRTC signaling

### 3. Frontend Implementation
- ✅ Created `BroadcastComponentMultiStream` with dual capture support
- ✅ Picture-in-picture preview with customizable position
- ✅ Separate quality settings for screen (text-optimized) and camera
- ✅ Real-time stream management (start/stop individual streams)
- ✅ Updated `StreamList` to show multi-stream sessions

### 4. Technical Improvements
- ✅ Content-aware optimization (detail for screen, motion for camera)
- ✅ Independent WebRTC connections per stream
- ✅ Dynamic PIX pricing based on active streams
- ✅ Updated SQLX offline cache for production builds

## New Features Available

### For Broadcasters
1. **Dual Streaming**
   - Stream screen and camera simultaneously
   - Toggle each stream on/off independently
   - Preview both streams before going live

2. **Enhanced Controls**
   - Position camera overlay (4 corners)
   - Adjust camera size (10-40% of screen)
   - Separate quality settings for each stream
   - Screen: 720p-4K optimized for text clarity
   - Camera: 360p-1080p optimized for motion

3. **Smart Pricing**
   - Base rate + addons for each stream type
   - Bundle discount when streaming both
   - Viewers only pay for streams they enable

### For Viewers  
1. **Flexible Viewing**
   - Choose which streams to watch
   - Customize layout preferences
   - Save bandwidth by disabling unwanted streams

2. **Better Experience**
   - Optimized quality for content type
   - Smooth switching between layouts
   - Persistent preferences per session

## Usage Examples

### Starting a Multi-Stream Broadcast
```javascript
// Frontend automatically handles:
- Screen capture via getDisplayMedia()
- Camera capture via getUserMedia()
- Separate WebRTC connections
- Real-time preview
```

### Viewer Customization
```javascript
// Viewers can:
- Toggle streams on/off
- Change PiP position
- Adjust overlay size
- Save preferences
```

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Scalability**: Each stream is independent
2. **Reliability**: If one stream fails, others continue
3. **Flexibility**: Easy to add more stream types (audio-only, etc.)
4. **Efficiency**: Viewers only receive streams they want
5. **Backward Compatible**: Old single-stream sessions still work

## Perfect for Workflow Feedback

The system is now ready for the original use case:
- **Screen sharing** for showing work/code
- **Camera overlay** for personal connection
- **High quality text** with optimized screen encoding
- **Real-time interaction** via chat
- **Session recording** for later review

## Next Steps

1. Deploy using `DEPLOYMENT_COMMANDS.md`
2. Test CORS fix first
3. Test multi-stream broadcasting
4. Monitor performance and gather feedback

The foundation is now in place for professional livestreaming with multiple sources!
