# Quick Decision Framework

## The Three Questions Test

Before implementing any feature or making any significant decision, ask:

1. **Does this give creators more control?** ✓/✗
2. **Does this reduce platform dependence?** ✓/✗
3. **Does this make creators the algorithm?** ✓/✗

**If any answer is ✗, reconsider the approach.**

## Quick Reference Examples

### Feature Requests

**"Add trending page"**
- More control? ✗ (Platform decides trends)
- Less dependence? ✗ (Creates algorithmic dependence)
- Creators = algorithm? ✗ (Platform becomes curator)
**Decision: NO**

**"Add creator analytics dashboard"**
- More control? ✓ (Knowledge is power)
- Less dependence? ✓ (Direct insights)
- Creators = algorithm? ✓ (Creators optimize themselves)
**Decision: YES**

**"Implement content recommendations"**
- More control? ✗ (Platform chooses visibility)
- Less dependence? ✗ (Creates discovery dependence)
- Creators = algorithm? ✗ (Algorithm drives views)
**Decision: NO** (Use search instead)

### Technical Decisions

**"Use proprietary video codec"**
- More control? ✗ (Locks content format)
- Less dependence? ✗ (Can't export easily)
- Creators = algorithm? ➖ (Neutral)
**Decision: NO**

**"Open API for all features"**
- More control? ✓ (Creators can build tools)
- Less dependence? ✓ (Not locked to our UI)
- Creators = algorithm? ✓ (Creators extend platform)
**Decision: YES**

### Business Decisions

**"30-day payment holding period"**
- More control? ✗ (Delays access to earnings)
- Less dependence? ✗ (Creates cash flow dependence)
- Creators = algorithm? ➖ (Neutral)
**Decision: NO**

**"Direct wallet integration"**
- More control? ✓ (Immediate access)
- Less dependence? ✓ (Standard crypto wallets)
- Creators = algorithm? ✓ (Success = immediate rewards)
**Decision: YES**

## Emergency Override

The ONLY acceptable reason to violate these principles:
- Legal compliance requirements
- Critical security vulnerabilities
- Temporary technical limitations (with clear fix timeline)

Even then, document why and plan immediate remediation.

## Remember

**We are building infrastructure, not a kingdom.**
