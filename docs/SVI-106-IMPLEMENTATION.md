# SVI-106: Mobile & Desktop App Implementation

## Overview

This document details the implementation of Pixr's mobile and desktop applications with facial and speaker recognition capabilities for indexing personal media libraries.

## Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed

1. **Architecture Documentation**
   - Comprehensive system design
   - Technology stack selection
   - Privacy-first approach

2. **Desktop App Foundation**
   - Electron main process setup
   - IPC communication layer
   - Service architecture

3. **Core Services**
   - MediaScanner: Discovers and processes media files
   - FaceRecognitionEngine: Face detection using face-api.js
   - DatabaseManager: Local NeDB storage

4. **Mobile App Structure**
   - React Native with Expo
   - Navigation setup
   - Service initialization

### ðŸš§ In Progress

1. **Face Recognition Models**
   - Need to download/include face-api models
   - Optimize for desktop performance

2. **UI Implementation**
   - React components for desktop
   - React Native screens for mobile

3. **Speaker Recognition**
   - Audio processing pipeline
   - Voice embedding extraction

## Key Features Implemented

### Desktop App

1. **Media Scanning**
   - Recursive directory scanning
   - Support for common image/video formats
   - Hash-based duplicate detection

2. **Face Processing**
   - Multi-face detection per image
   - 128D face embeddings
   - Person clustering algorithm

3. **Local Database**
   - Encrypted local storage
   - Indexed queries
   - Person-media relationships

### Mobile App

1. **Permission Management**
   - Camera access
   - Media library access
   - Storage permissions

2. **Navigation**
   - Tab-based navigation
   - Four main screens: Library, People, Search, Settings

3. **TensorFlow Integration**
   - React Native TensorFlow.js setup
   - Model loading infrastructure

## Privacy & Security Features

1. **Local-First Processing**
   - All ML inference happens on-device
   - No required internet connection
   - User controls all data

2. **Data Protection**
   - Local database encryption
   - Secure IPC communication
   - No telemetry

3. **User Control**
   - Delete any detection
   - Export all data
   - Clear all data

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Phase 1)
1. Download face-api models
2. Implement basic UI components
3. Test media scanning functionality
4. Create person management interface

### Short-term (Phase 2)
1. Implement speaker recognition
2. Add video processing
3. Create search functionality
4. Mobile app media access

### Long-term (Phase 3)
1. Scene detection
2. Object recognition
3. Natural language search
4. Pixr platform integration

## Usage Instructions

### Desktop App

```bash
cd apps/desktop
npm install
npm run download-models  # Need to implement
npm run dev
```

### Mobile App

```bash
cd apps/mobile
npm install
expo start
```

## Technical Decisions

1. **Electron for Desktop**: Cross-platform, native performance
2. **React Native for Mobile**: Code reuse, Expo ecosystem
3. **face-api.js**: Proven face recognition library
4. **Local Database**: Privacy-first, no cloud dependency
5. **TensorFlow.js**: Client-side ML inference

## Integration with Pixr Platform

The apps are designed to work standalone but can optionally:
- Upload processed content to Pixr
- Sync person identities across devices
- Leverage Pixr's video processing
- Enable content monetization

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: Service logic, ML accuracy
2. **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflows
3. **Performance Tests**: Large library handling
4. **Privacy Tests**: Data isolation verification

## Conclusion

The foundation for both mobile and desktop apps has been established with a focus on privacy, performance, and user control. The architecture supports the core requirements while allowing for future enhancements.
