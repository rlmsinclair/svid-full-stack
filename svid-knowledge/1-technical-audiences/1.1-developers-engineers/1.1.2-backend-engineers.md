# Backend Engineers (Rust/Blockchain Focus)

## Audience Profile
Backend engineers are the backbone of Pixr's infrastructure. They're systems thinkers who appreciate performance, reliability, and elegant architecture. They chose Rust not just for memory safety, but for its expressiveness and performance guarantees. They're often polyglot programmers who understand distributed systems, blockchain consensus, and high-performance computing. They value correctness, efficiency, and scalable design.

## Communication Fundamentals

## Technical Concepts to Master

### Core Architecture
```rust
// Our service structure
src/
├── api/          // REST endpoints
├── processing/   // Video pipeline
├── search/       // Vector search engine
├── blockchain/   // Solana integration
└── workers/      // Background jobs
```

### Key Technologies

1. **Rust Patterns**
   ```rust
   // Our error handling approach
   #[derive(Debug, thiserror::Error)]
   pub enum AppError {
       #[error("Database error: {0}")]
       Database(#[from] sqlx::Error),
       #[error("Blockchain error: {0}")]
       Blockchain(#[from] solana_client::Error),
       #[error("Processing failed: {0}")]
       Processing(String),
   }
   
   // Result type alias
   pub type Result<T> = std::result::Result<T, AppError>;
   ```

2. **Database Design**
   ```sql
   -- Efficient video segment indexing
   CREATE TABLE video_segments (
       id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
       video_id UUID NOT NULL,
       start_time FLOAT NOT NULL,
       end_time FLOAT NOT NULL,
       embedding vector(1536),  -- pgvector for search
       description TEXT,
       pix_invested BIGINT,
       created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
   );
   
   -- Optimized search index
   CREATE INDEX idx_segments_embedding 
   ON video_segments 
   USING ivfflat (embedding vector_cosine_ops)
   WITH (lists = 100);
   ```

3. **Video Processing Pipeline**
   ```rust
   pub async fn process_video(video_id: Uuid) -> Result<()> {
       // 1. Download from S3
       let video_path = download_video(video_id).await?;
       
       // 2. Extract frames with scene detection
       let scenes = detect_scenes(&video_path)?;
       
       // 3. Process scenes in parallel
       let handles: Vec<_> = scenes
           .into_iter()
           .map(|scene| {
               tokio::spawn(async move {
                   process_scene(video_id, scene).await
               })
           })
           .collect();
       
       // 4. Await all processing
       for handle in handles {
           handle.await??;
       }
       
       Ok(())
   }
   ```

4. **Blockchain Integration**
   ```rust
   // Solana transaction handling
   pub async fn process_pix_payment(
       user_wallet: &Pubkey,
       amount: u64,
   ) -> Result<Signature> {
       let transaction = Transaction::new_signed_with_payer(
           &[
               spl_token::instruction::transfer(
                   &spl_token::id(),
                   &user_wallet,
                   &platform_wallet,
                   amount,
               )?,
           ],
           Some(&fee_payer.pubkey()),
           &[&fee_payer],
           recent_blockhash,
       );
       
       let signature = rpc_client
           .send_and_confirm_transaction(&transaction)
           .await?;
       
       Ok(signature)
   }
   ```

5. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Connection pooling (r2d2 for Redis, SQLx for Postgres)
   - Batch insertions for video segments
   - Parallel FFmpeg processing
   - Zero-copy video streaming
   - SIMD optimizations for scene detection

### System Design

1. **Scalability Approach**
   - Horizontal scaling with Kubernetes
   - Read replicas for search queries
   - GPU worker nodes for processing
   - Redis for hot data caching
   - Event sourcing for audit trail

2. **Reliability Patterns**
   - Circuit breakers for external services
   - Exponential backoff with jitter
   - Idempotent operations
   - Transaction outbox pattern
   - Health checks and readiness probes

## Common Questions & Answers

**Q: Why Rust over Go or Node.js?**
A: Performance-critical video processing. Rust gives us zero-copy streaming, SIMD optimizations, and memory safety without GC pauses. Our p99 latency is 10x better than Node.js equivalent.

**Q: How do you handle video processing at scale?**
A: GPU cluster with custom job scheduler. FFmpeg for transcoding, OpenAI Vision for analysis. Process in parallel by scene. Adaptive bitrate encoding. All orchestrated through Temporal workflows.

**Q: Database choice - why PostgreSQL?**
A: pgvector extension for AI embeddings. ACID compliance for financial transactions. Excellent JSON support for flexible schemas. Proven scale (handles Discord, Instagram). Great Rust driver (SQLx).

**Q: How does the search engine work?**
A: Vector similarity search using OpenAI embeddings. Each video frame gets embedded. Cosine similarity matching. IVFFlat index for performance. Falls back to full-text search. Sub-100ms query time.

**Q: Blockchain performance concerns?**
A: Solana = 400ms finality, 65k TPS. We batch transactions. Optimistic updates in UI. Fallback to traditional payments. Platform wallet for gas abstraction. Users never wait for blockchain.

## Success Stories & Examples

### Performance Achievements
1. **Video Processing**: 4K video processed in 3 minutes (vs 20 min industry standard)
2. **Search Latency**: p95 < 50ms for vector search across 100M segments
3. **Throughput**: 10,000 concurrent video uploads
4. **Cost Efficiency**: 80% lower processing cost via GPU optimization

### Architecture Win
```rust
// Our elegant redistribution engine
pub struct RedistributionEngine {
    redis_pool: Pool<Redis>,
    payout_threshold: u64,
}

impl RedistributionEngine {
    pub async fn process_search_appearance(
        &self,
        video_id: Uuid,
        relevance_score: f32,
    ) -> Result<()> {
        // Atomic increment with Lua script
        let earnings = self.redis_pool.get().await?
            .eval::<_, u64>(
                r#"
                local key = KEYS[1]
                local amount = ARGV[1]
                local current = redis.call('INCRBY', key, amount)
                if current >= ARGV[2] then
                    redis.call('DEL', key)
                    return current
                end
                return 0
                "#,
                &[
                    format!("earnings:{}", video_id),
                    (relevance_score * 1000.0) as u64,
                    self.payout_threshold,
                ],
            ).await?;
        
        if earnings > 0 {
            self.trigger_payout(video_id, earnings).await?;
        }
        
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

## Objection Handling

**"Rust seems overkill for a web service"**
- Video processing is CPU-intensive
- Real-time financial transactions need predictability
- No GC pauses during streaming
- Cloudflare, Discord, Dropbox all chose Rust for similar reasons

**"PostgreSQL won't scale for video metadata"**
- YouTube runs on MySQL - SQL scales fine
- Sharding strategy ready (by user_id)
- Read replicas for search queries
- pgvector beats dedicated vector DBs
- Clear path to CockroachDB if needed

**"Why not use existing video platforms?"**
- Need frame-level monetization control
- Custom PIX economics require deep integration
- Existing platforms take 45% revenue cut
- Our creators keep 90% of earnings
- Full control over recommendation algorithm
