            weights=self.pix_to_weights(pix_budget)
        )
        
        return fused
```

### Key Technologies

1. **Embedding Systems**
   ```python
   # Video segment embedding
   @dataclass
   class VideoSegment:
       start_time: float
       end_time: float
       visual_embedding: np.ndarray  # CLIP ViT-L/14
       text_embedding: np.ndarray    # Ada-002
       audio_embedding: np.ndarray   # Wav2Vec2
       combined_embedding: np.ndarray # Fusion output
       pix_weight: float            # Investment influence
   
   # Similarity search
   def search(query: str, modality: str = "all"):
       query_embed = encode_query(query, modality)
       
       results = pgvector.search(
           query_embed,
           metric="cosine",
           k=100,
           ef_search=200  # HNSW parameter
       )
       
       return rerank_by_pix(results)
   ```

2. **Scene Detection & Sampling**
   ```python
   # Perceptual hash-based scene detection
   def detect_scenes(video_path: str) -> List[Scene]:
       frames = extract_frames(video_path, fps=5)
       hashes = [phash(frame) for frame in frames]
       
       scenes = []
       scene_start = 0
       
       for i in range(1, len(hashes)):
           if hamming_distance(hashes[i-1], hashes[i]) > 10:
               scenes.append(Scene(
                   start=scene_start * 0.2,  # 5 fps
                   end=i * 0.2
               ))
               scene_start = i
       
       return scenes
   
   # PIX-aware sampling
   def allocate_pix_budget(scenes: List[Scene], total_pix: int):
       # Distribute PIX based on scene importance
       scene_lengths = [s.end - s.start for s in scenes]
       total_length = sum(scene_lengths)
       
       allocations = []
       for scene, length in zip(scenes, scene_lengths):
           # Base allocation proportional to length
           base = int(total_pix * length / total_length)
           
           # Boost for high-motion scenes
           motion_score = calculate_motion(scene)
           boost = int(base * motion_score * 0.5)
           
           allocations.append(base + boost)
       
       return allocations
   ```

3. **Consciousness Features**
   ```python
   class ConsciousnessEngine:
       """Predictive video recommendation system"""
       
       def __init__(self):
           self.behavior_encoder = TransformerEncoder(
               dim=512,
               depth=6,
               heads=8
           )
           self.pattern_detector = LSTMPatternDetector()
           self.predictor = NextTokenPredictor()
       
       def predict_next_need(self, user_history: List[Event]):
           # Encode behavioral sequence
           behavior_seq = self.behavior_encoder([
               self.encode_event(e) for e in user_history
           ])
           
           # Detect learning patterns
           patterns = self.pattern_detector(behavior_seq)
           
           # Predict next video need
           if patterns.is_learning_sequence:
               return self.predict_next_lesson(patterns)
           elif patterns.is_exploratory:
               return self.suggest_related_topics(patterns)
           else:
               return self.general_recommendation(behavior_seq)
       
       def encode_event(self, event: Event):
           return np.concatenate([
               event.video_embedding,
               event.interaction_features,  # dwell, clicks, etc
               event.temporal_features,     # time of day, gap
               event.search_context        # query if available
           ])
   ```

4. **Production Optimizations**
   ```python
   # ONNX Runtime for inference
   class OptimizedCLIP:
       def __init__(self):
           self.session = onnxruntime.InferenceSession(
               "clip_vit_l14.onnx",
               providers=['TensorrtExecutionProvider']
           )
       
       def encode(self, images: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
           # Batch processing with optimal size
           batch_size = 64
           embeddings = []
           
           for i in range(0, len(images), batch_size):
               batch = images[i:i+batch_size]
               inputs = {
                   self.session.get_inputs()[0].name: batch
               }
               outputs = self.session.run(None, inputs)
               embeddings.append(outputs[0])
           
           return np.vstack(embeddings)
   ```

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Multi-Modal Fusion Strategy**
   - Late fusion for flexibility
   - Cross-attention for modality interaction
   - PIX-weighted importance
   - Ablation studies show 23% improvement

2. **Embedding Choice**
   - CLIP for vision (zero-shot capability)
   - Ada-002 for text (superior retrieval)
   - Wav2Vec2 for audio (temporal awareness)
   - Custom fusion layer trained on platform data

3. **Search Architecture**
   - pgvector for simplicity and SQL integration
   - IVFFlat index with 100 lists
   - Hybrid search: vector + keyword
   - Re-ranking based on PIX investment

## Common Questions & Answers

**Q: Why not use newer models like DALL-E 3 or GPT-4V?**
A: Latency and cost. CLIP gives us 50ms inference vs 2s for GPT-4V. We process millions of frames daily. Cost would be prohibitive. We use GPT-4V selectively for high-PIX content.

**Q: How does PIX investment affect search quality?**
A: More PIX = more frames analyzed = better temporal coverage. Also affects ranking weight. High-PIX videos get embedding boost in search results. Creates quality signal beyond just relevance.

**Q: Consciousness features seem like recommendation. What's different?**
A: Predictive vs reactive. YouTube recommends based on what you watched. We predict what you'll need next based on behavioral patterns. It's the difference between following and leading.

**Q: How do you handle different video types (tutorials, vlogs, music)?**
A: Domain-adaptive processing. Tutorials get transcript weight boost. Music videos prioritize audio embeddings. Vlogs balance all modalities. PIX allocation strategy adapts per category.

**Q: What about bias in AI models?**
A: Multi-level approach: diverse training data, bias detection metrics, human-in-the-loop for high-stakes decisions. Open-source videos help dataset diversity. Regular audits published publicly.

## Objection Handling

**"Seems like over-engineering. Why not simple keyword search?"**
- Keyword search misses 90% of video content
- "Show me that cooking technique" - which keywords?
- Visual search finds unnamed concepts
- Creators shouldn't need SEO expertise

**"CLIP is outdated. Why not use latest models?"**
- CLIP is production-tested at scale
- Open weights allow optimization
- Newer isn't always better for production
- We fine-tune CLIP on video-specific data
- Upgrade path ready when models mature

**"How is this different from YouTube's search?"**
- YouTube uses engagement signals (views, likes)
- We use content understanding + creator investment
- No "rich get richer" algorithm
- Transparent: PIX investment directly affects discovery
- Multi-modal from day one
