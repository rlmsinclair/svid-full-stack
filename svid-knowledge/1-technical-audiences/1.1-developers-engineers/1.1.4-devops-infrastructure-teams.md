# DevOps & Infrastructure Teams

## Audience Profile
DevOps engineers are the unsung heroes who keep Pixr running 24/7. They're systems thinkers who see the big picture - from code commit to production deployment. They value automation, reliability, and efficiency. They're often on-call warriors who've seen systems fail at 3 AM and lived to tell the tale. They appreciate elegant solutions to complex distributed systems problems and have strong opinions about monitoring, deployment, and incident response.

## Communication Fundamentals

### Body Language & Presence
- **Posture**: Calm and steady - you're discussing critical systems
- **Gestures**: Use diagrams for architecture, timelines for incidents
- **Eye Contact**: Direct and reassuring - build trust
- **Energy**: Measured but passionate about reliability

### Tone & Approach
- **Language**: Practical and operational - focus on what works
- **Pace**: Steady - these are important decisions
- **Style**: Problem-solver who's been in the trenches
- **Empathy**: Acknowledge their on-call burden

### Confidence Builders

         - name: video-storage
           persistentVolumeClaim:
             claimName: video-processing-pvc
   ```

2. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   ```yaml
   # GitHub Actions workflow
   name: Deploy to Production
   on:
     push:
       branches: [main]
   
   jobs:
     test:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:

             --revision ${{ github.sha }} \
             --prune --force
   ```

3. **Monitoring Stack**
   ```yaml
   # Prometheus rules for SLOs
   groups:
   - name: pixr-slos
     interval: 30s
     rules:
     - record: api_request_success_rate
       expr: |
         sum(rate(http_requests_total{status=~"2.."}[5m]))
         /
         sum(rate(http_requests_total[5m]))
     
     - alert: APIErrorBudgetBurn
       expr: |
         (
           1 - api_request_success_rate
         ) > (1 - 0.999) * 14.4
       labels:
         severity: page
       annotations:
         summary: "API error budget burn rate too high"
         description: "Error rate is {{ $value }}%"
   
   # Custom GPU metrics
   - record: gpu_processing_efficiency
     expr: |
       sum(rate(video_frames_processed[5m]))
       /
       sum(nvidia_gpu_duty_cycle)
   ```

4. **Infrastructure as Code**
   ```hcl
   # Terraform for GPU nodes
   resource "aws_eks_node_group" "gpu_workers" {
     cluster_name    = aws_eks_cluster.pixr.name
     node_group_name = "gpu-workers"
     node_role_arn   = aws_iam_role.gpu_node.arn
     subnet_ids      = aws_subnet.private[*].id
     
     instance_types = ["g4dn.xlarge"]  # T4 GPUs
     
     scaling_config {
       desired_size = 10
       max_size     = 50
       min_size     = 2
     }
     
     launch_template {
       id      = aws_launch_template.gpu_node.id
       version = "$Latest"
     }
     
     tags = {
       "k8s.io/cluster-autoscaler/enabled" = "true"
       "k8s.io/cluster-autoscaler/pixr"    = "owned"
     }
   }
   
   # Spot instances for cost optimization
   resource "aws_launch_template" "gpu_node" {
     name_prefix = "pixr-gpu-node"
     
     instance_market_options {
       market_type = "spot"
       spot_options {
         max_price = "0.50"  # 50% savings
       }
     }
     
     user_data = base64encode(templatefile("gpu-init.sh", {
       cluster_name = aws_eks_cluster.pixr.name
       nvidia_driver_version = "525.85.12"
     }))
   }
   ```

5. **Disaster Recovery**
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   # Automated backup script
   
   # Database backups
   pg_dump $DATABASE_URL | \
     aws s3 cp - s3://pixr-backups/postgres/$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).sql.gz \
     --storage-class GLACIER
   
   # Video metadata sync
   aws s3 sync \
     s3://pixr-videos-primary/ \
     s3://pixr-videos-backup/ \
     --storage-class STANDARD_IA
   
   # Kubernetes state backup
   velero backup create daily-$(date +%Y%m%d) \
     --include-namespaces pixr-production \
     --ttl 720h
   ```

### System Design

1. **High Availability**
   - Multi-AZ Kubernetes deployment
   - Database read replicas
   - CDN for video delivery
   - Circuit breakers for dependencies
   - Graceful degradation

2. **Cost Optimization**
   - Spot instances for GPU workers (70% savings)
   - S3 lifecycle policies
   - Intelligent tiering for videos
   - Reserved instances for baseline
   - FinOps dashboards

3. **Security Hardening**
   - Network policies in Kubernetes
   - Pod security standards
   - Secrets management (Vault)
   - mTLS between services
   - Regular security scans

## Common Questions & Answers

**Q: How do you handle GPU scheduling?**
A: Custom scheduler that considers: GPU memory requirements, CUDA version compatibility, job priority (based on PIX investment), and spot instance availability. Preemption handled gracefully.

**Q: What's your deployment strategy?**
A: Blue-green for API services, rolling updates for workers. Feature flags for gradual rollout. Automated rollback on SLO breach. Preview environments for every PR.

**Q: Database scaling approach?**
A: PostgreSQL with read replicas. pgBouncer for connection pooling. Planned sharding by user_id. Redis for hot data. TimescaleDB for time-series metrics.

**Q: How do you monitor GPU costs?**
A: Custom exporters track GPU time per job. Cost allocation by user/video. Spot instance savings tracked. Daily cost reports. Budget alerts at 80% threshold.

**Q: Incident response process?**
A: PagerDuty integration. Runbooks in Notion. Automated diagnostics. War room Discord channel. Blameless post-mortems. Error budget tracking.

## Objection Handling

**"Kubernetes seems overkill for a startup"**
- Already at scale: processing millions of videos
- GPU workloads need orchestration
- Auto-scaling saves 70% on compute
- Kubernetes is industry standard
- Managed EKS reduces complexity

**"Why not serverless?"**
- GPU workloads don't fit Lambda
- Video processing needs persistent connections
- Cost predictability important
- Cold starts unacceptable for search
- Hybrid approach where appropriate

**"Multi-cloud concerns?"**
- Not locked to AWS: Kubernetes abstracts infrastructure
- S3 API compatibility everywhere
- Database can migrate (PostgreSQL)
- CDN already multi-provider
- DR plan includes GCP failover
