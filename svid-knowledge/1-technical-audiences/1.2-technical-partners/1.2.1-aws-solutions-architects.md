   ```python
   # Spot-resilient GPU processing
   class GPUJobScheduler:
       def __init__(self):
           self.spot_fleet = boto3.client('ec2')
           self.sqs = boto3.client('sqs')
           self.cloudwatch = boto3.client('cloudwatch')
       
       def launch_spot_fleet(self):
           return self.spot_fleet.create_fleet(
               SpotOptions={
                   'AllocationStrategy': 'capacity-optimized',
                   'InstanceInterruptionBehavior': 'terminate',
                   'InstancePoolsToUseCount': 2
               },
               LaunchTemplateConfigs=[{
                   'LaunchTemplateSpecification': {
                       'LaunchTemplateId': self.gpu_template_id,
                       'Version': '$Latest'
                   },
                   'Overrides': [
                       {'InstanceType': 'g4dn.xlarge'},
                       {'InstanceType': 'g4dn.2xlarge'},
                       {'InstanceType': 'g5.xlarge'}
                   ]
               }],
               TargetCapacitySpecification={
                   'TotalTargetCapacity': 20,
                   'OnDemandTargetCapacity': 2,  # Baseline
                   'SpotTargetCapacity': 18
               }
           )
   ```

2. **Multi-Region Architecture**
   ```yaml
   # CloudFormation for multi-region

               Status: Enabled
               Priority: 1
               Filter:
                 Prefix: videos/
               Destination:

   def configure_s3_lifecycle():
       s3 = boto3.client('s3')
       
       lifecycle_policy = {
           'Rules': [{
               'ID': 'IntelligentTiering',
               'Status': 'Enabled',
               'Filter': {'Prefix': 'videos/'},

           }]
       }
       
       s3.put_bucket_lifecycle_configuration(
           Bucket='pixr-videos',
           LifecycleConfiguration=lifecycle_policy
       )
   
   # Compute Optimizer recommendations
   def rightsize_instances():
       optimizer = boto3.client('compute-optimizer')
       
       recommendations = optimizer.get_ec2_instance_recommendations(
           instanceArns=['arn:aws:ec2:*:*:instance/*']
       )
       
       for rec in recommendations['instanceRecommendations']:
           if rec['finding'] == 'OVER_PROVISIONED':
               print(f"Downsize {rec['instanceArn']} to {rec['recommendationOptions'][0]['instanceType']}")

## Common Questions & Answers

**Q: Why not use SageMaker for ML workloads?**
A: Evaluated it. Our video processing needs custom CUDA kernels. SageMaker great for training, but inference needs more control. Planning to use SageMaker for next-gen model training.

**Q: How do you handle video delivery at scale?**
A: CloudFront with S3 origins. Custom cache behaviors per resolution. Origin Shield in us-east-1. Lambda@Edge for auth. Seeing 98% cache hit ratio.

**Q: Database strategy for growth?**
A: RDS PostgreSQL now, evaluating Aurora. Need pgvector support. Read replicas for search. Considering DynamoDB for user sessions. Clear migration path planned.

**Q: What about Bedrock for AI features?**
A: Actively evaluating. Claude via Bedrock for content moderation. Cost comparing with direct OpenAI. Bedrock Knowledge Bases interesting for documentation search.

**Q: Disaster recovery plan?**
A: Pilot light in us-west-2. S3 cross-region replication. RDS automated backups. Route 53 health checks. <5 minute RTO for critical services. Testing quarterly.
