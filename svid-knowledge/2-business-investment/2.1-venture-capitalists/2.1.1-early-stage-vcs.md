# Early-Stage VCs (Seed/Series A)

They're looking for massive markets, exceptional founders, and unfair advantages. They value conviction over perfection, speed over polish. They're comfortable with risk but obsessed with upside.

## Common Questions & Answers

**Q: Why would creators pay to upload?**
A: They're not paying to upload - they're investing in discoverability. Current platforms: upload free, never discovered. Pixr: invest $100, earn $1000+ from searches. ROI-positive for quality content.

**Q: How do you compete with free platforms?**
A: We don't compete - we complement. Creators use YouTube for audience, Pixr for monetization. Like Instagram vs OnlyFans. Different use cases, same creators.

**Q: What's defensible here?**
A: Network effects (more creators = better search). Switching costs (PIX investment). Technical moat (AI + blockchain). Brand ("Be The Algorithm"). First-mover in category.

**Q: How big can this really get?**
A: YouTube = $30B revenue. We need 1% of creators for $1B opportunity. But we enable new use cases: corporate training, education, specialized content. True TAM much larger.

**Q: What about content moderation?**
A: AI pre-screening (Llama model). Community reporting. Staked moderation (lose PIX for violations). Transparent appeals. Less problematic due to investment requirement.
