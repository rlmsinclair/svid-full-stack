## Common Questions & Answers

**Q: How sustainable is 73% monthly growth?**
A: Natural deceleration expected. Projecting 20% MoM by Q4, 10% by 2025. Still exceptional for our scale. Multiple growth drivers beyond viral.

**Q: Gross margins seem too high - what's missing?**
A: Infrastructure costs included. Benefit from GPU spot instances, efficient Rust code, and improving AI models. Margins actually improving with scale.

**Q: Competitive response from YouTube?**
A: Innovator's dilemma. They can't cannibalize $30B ad business. We're growing their complement, not replacement. Many creators use both.

**Q: International expansion complexity?**
A: Payment localization via Stripe. Content moderation via AI. Legal entities established. LATAM already 40% of growth organically.

**Q: Path to profitability?**
A: Profitable unit economics today. Could be EBITDA positive immediately. Choosing growth over profitability. Clear path to Rule of 40 compliance.
