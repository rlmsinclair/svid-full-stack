# Crypto/Web3 Funds

## Audience Profile
Crypto VCs are paradigm shifters and token economists. They've made fortunes betting on decentralization and aren't afraid of volatility. They understand mechanism design, token economics, and the power of community ownership. They value genuine utility over speculation, sustainable tokenomics over pump-and-dump. They're often former traders, protocol developers, or DeFi architects who see blockchain as the future of the internet. They think in terms of network effects, governance, and aligned incentives.

## Token Economics Deep Dive

### PIX Token Design
```solidity
// Token Utility Model
TokenUtility {
    // Primary Utility: Video Processing
    VideoIndexing: {
        cost: "1M PIX per HD video",
        burn: "50% burned, 50% to rewards pool",
        demand: "Directly tied to platform usage"
    },
    
    // Secondary Utility: Priority Access
    SearchPriority: {
        stake: "Hold PIX for search benefits",
        boost: "10x PIX = 2x search relevance",
        lockup: "30-day minimum stake"
    },
    
    // Tertiary Utility: Governance
    Governance: {
        proposals: "1M PIX to propose",
        voting: "1 PIX = 1 vote",
        scope: "Fee structures, feature priority"
    }
}

// Token Distribution
Distribution {
    creators: 40%,      // Earned through platform
    investors: 20%,     // Vested 4 years
    team: 15%,         // Vested 4 years, 1 year cliff
    treasury: 15%,     // DAO-controlled
    ecosystem: 10%     // Grants and incentives
}
```

### Tokenomics Modeling
```python
# Supply/Demand Dynamics
class PIXEconomics:
    def __init__(self):
        self.total_supply = 10_000_000_000  # 10B PIX
        self.circulating = 1_000_000_000    # 1B initial
        self.burn_rate = 0.5                # 50% of usage burned
        self.daily_video_uploads = 10_000
        self.avg_pix_per_video = 5_000_000
    
    def daily_burn(self):
        usage = self.daily_video_uploads * self.avg_pix_per_video
        return usage * self.burn_rate
    
    def annual_deflation(self):
        daily = self.daily_burn()
        annual = daily * 365
        return annual / self.circulating  # 9.1% deflation
    
    def equilibrium_price(self, daily_usd_demand):
        # Velocity = 4 (quarterly video processing)
        market_cap_needed = daily_usd_demand * 365 / 4
        return market_cap_needed / self.circulating

# Model shows sustainable economics at scale
```

## Web3-Native Features

### Creator Sovereignty
```javascript
// Creator-Owned Content Registry
class CreatorRegistry {
    // On-chain content ownership
    async registerVideo(videoHash, metadata) {
        const nft = await metaplex.nfts().create({
            uri: metadata.arweaveUrl,
            name: metadata.title,
            symbol: "PIXR",
            sellerFeeBasisPoints: 250, // 2.5% royalties
            creators: [{
                address: creatorWallet,
                verified: true,
                share: 100
            }]
        });
        
        return nft.address;
    }
    
    // Composable with other protocols
    async enableDeFi(nftAddress) {
        // Fractionalize for investment
        await fractional.split(nftAddress, 1000);
        
        // Enable lending
        await solend.whitelist(nftAddress);
        
        // Create liquidity pool
        await raydium.createPool(nftAddress, USDC);
    }
}
```

### Novel Staking Mechanisms
```rust
// Visibility Staking Program
pub mod visibility_staking {
    pub fn stake_for_boost(
        ctx: Context<StakeForBoost>,
        amount: u64,
        duration: i64,
    ) -> Result<()> {
        // Longer stakes = higher multipliers
        let multiplier = match duration {
            0..=30 => 1.0,
            31..=90 => 1.5,
            91..=180 => 2.0,
            181..=365 => 3.0,
            _ => 5.0,
        };
        
        // Lock tokens in escrow
        let stake_account = &mut ctx.accounts.stake;
        stake_account.amount = amount;
        stake_account.multiplier = multiplier;
        stake_account.unlock_time = Clock::get()?.unix_timestamp + duration;
        
        // Transfer to PDA
        token::transfer(
            ctx.accounts.into_transfer_context(),
            amount,
        )?;
        
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

## Common Questions & Answers

**Q: Why not fully decentralized from day one?**
A: Progressive decentralization works. Need product-market fit first. Uniswap, Compound followed same path. Decentralization roadmap clear.

**Q: Token seems like payment token, not investment?**
A: Utility drives value. MKR, UNI valuable due to utility. PIX has burn mechanism, staking rewards, governance rights. Investment characteristics emerge from utility.

**Q: How does this compare to other creator tokens?**
A: Rally, BitClout failed due to speculation focus. We solve real problem (discovery). Token has clear utility. Creators earn USDC, not volatile tokens.

**Q: Cross-chain plans?**
A: Solana-first for speed/cost. Bridge to Ethereum for DeFi composability. Evaluating Cosmos for interoperability. Architecture supports multi-chain.

**Q: Regulatory concerns?**
A: Utility token, not security. No investment promises. Decentralized over time. Legal opinion from a16z counsel. Similar to file storage tokens.
