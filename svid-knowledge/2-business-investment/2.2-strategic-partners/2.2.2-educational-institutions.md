### Student Success Stories

```
Engineering Student - Maria:
"Before Pixr, I'd spend hours rewatching entire lectures to find one concept. Now I search 'moment of inertia example' and jump right to it. My study time is cut in half, and I actually understand the material better."

Medical Student - James:
"In anatomy, being able to search for 'ventricle contraction' across all lectures and lab videos saved my life. I can see the same concept explained different ways instantly."

International Student - Wei:
"The multilingual search helps me find concepts in my native language first, then see the English explanation. It's bridged the language gap in my learning."
```
