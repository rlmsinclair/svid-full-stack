## Common Questions & Answers

**Q: Why list PIX? Is there enough trading demand?**
A: PIX has real, non-speculative demand from creators needing to index content. As the platform grows 73% MoM, demand for PIX grows with it. This creates a constant buy pressure and a healthy trading environment beyond speculation.

**Q: What's the token's velocity? Is it just a payment token?**
A: Velocity is managed through multiple mechanisms. Staking for visibility locks up supply. The burn mechanism creates deflationary pressure. And governance rights give long-term holding utility. It's a utility token with strong value accrual, not just a pass-through payment token.

**Q: How do you handle regulatory compliance (e.g., securities classification)?**
A: PIX is designed as a utility token. Its primary purpose is to access a service (video indexing). We have a legal opinion from a top-tier law firm (e.g., a16z counsel) confirming its utility status. We are committed to working with regulators and complying with all jurisdictional requirements.

**Q: What about competition from other creator platforms?**
A: We are the first to implement a "Be The Algorithm" model with a utility token at its core. Our technical moat (Rust backend, Solana integration, proprietary AI) and first-mover advantage in this new category give us a strong competitive edge.

**Q: What is your plan for wallet and custody support?**
A: We have a secure, audited custodial wallet solution for new Web3 users. We also fully support non-custodial wallets like Phantom and Solflare. We would work closely with your team to integrate your exchange's native wallet for a seamless user experience.
