# DeFi Protocols

## Audience Profile
DeFi protocol developers and governance members are the architects of decentralized finance. They are deeply technical, often anonymous or pseudonymous, and value elegant mechanism design, security, and composability. They are looking for high-quality, yield-generating collateral and real-world use cases to integrate into their protocols. They think in terms of Total Value Locked (TVL), capital efficiency, and protocol-owned liquidity. They are building the permissionless financial system of the future.

## Communication Fundamentals

### Body Language & Presence
- **Setting**: Primarily online (Discord, Telegram, forums)
- **Style**: Peer-to-peer, technical, and direct
- **Tone**: Respectful, collaborative, and focused on mutual benefit
- **Identity**: Your project's reputation and on-chain history are more important than your personal identity

### Confidence Builders
- Have audited smart contracts ready for review
- Provide a clear, public tokenomics model
- Demonstrate deep understanding of their protocol's mechanics
- Show active on-chain activity and a strong community

## Key Value Propositions

### For DeFi Protocols
1. **High-Quality Collateral**
   - PIX is a utility token with intrinsic demand tied to a real-world service (video indexing), reducing purely speculative volatility.
   - The PIX token has a deflationary burning mechanism, creating a positive feedback loop for its value.
   - The underlying platform generates real revenue ($365K MRR), providing a fundamental backing for the token's value.

2. **Novel Yield Sources**
   - **Staking for Visibility**: Creators stake PIX to boost their content, creating a natural yield source for stakers (liquidity providers).
   - **Revenue-Generating NFTs**: Videos can be represented as NFTs that earn real-time revenue from searches, creating a new asset class for lending and fractionalization.
   - **Investment Marketplace**: Our platform facilitates investments in video upgrades, creating opportunities for yield farming and structured products.

3. **Ecosystem Expansion**
   - **New User Base**: Tap into the massive creator economy, bringing millions of Web2-native users into your DeFi ecosystem.
   - **Composable Primitives**: Integrate our creator-centric financial primitives (e.g., instant royalty streams, video-backed loans) into your protocol.
   - **Real-World Use Case**: Showcase your protocol's power by integrating with a high-growth, real-world application beyond financial speculation.

## Integration Proposals

### 1. Lending & Borrowing Protocols (e.g., Aave, Compound, Solend)
```yaml
Proposal: List PIX as a collateral asset.

Benefits for Your Protocol:
  - New Asset: Attract PIX holders to your platform.
  - Increased TVL: Users deposit PIX to borrow stablecoins or other assets.
  - Revenue: Generate interest and liquidation fees from PIX markets.

Why PIX is Good Collateral:
  - Intrinsic Demand: Constant buy pressure from creators needing to index videos.
  - Price Stability: Less volatile than purely speculative tokens due to real utility.
  - Liquid Markets: Deep liquidity on major DEXs and CEXs.

Technical Integration:
  - Oracle: Chainlink price feed for PIX/USD is in development.
  - Risk Parameters: We propose conservative initial parameters (e.g., 40% LTV, 65% liquidation threshold) to ensure protocol safety.
  - Smart Contracts: Our SPL token contract is audited and standard-compliant.
```

### 2. Decentralized Exchanges (e.g., Uniswap, Orca, Raydium)
```yaml
Proposal: Deepen PIX liquidity pools and create novel pool types.

Benefits for Your Protocol:
  - Trading Volume: PIX's utility drives consistent trading volume.
  - LP Yield: High volume and platform incentives create attractive yields for liquidity providers.
  - Protocol-Owned Liquidity: We are open to partnering on POL initiatives to ensure sustainable liquidity.

Integration Ideas:
  - PIX/USDC & PIX/SOL Pools: Standard liquidity pools.
  - Concentrated Liquidity: Utilize your CLMM for capital-efficient PIX trading.
  - Video NFT Pools: Create pools for trading fractionalized video NFTs, a new asset class.
  - Staked PIX Derivatives: Create liquid staking tokens (e.g., sPIX) that can be traded on your DEX while earning staking rewards.
```

### 3. Yield & Staking Protocols (e.g., Lido, Marinade)
```yaml
Proposal: Integrate PIX staking into your platform.

Benefits for Your Protocol:
  - New Staking Asset: Offer your users a new way to earn real yield.
  - Real Yield Source: PIX staking rewards are generated from real platform revenue (indexing fees), not just token inflation.
  - Liquid Staking: Create a liquid staked PIX derivative (sPIX) that users can use across DeFi while earning rewards.

Staking Mechanism:
  - Users stake PIX through your protocol.
  - Your protocol delegates the PIX to our "Visibility Staking" contract.
  - The contract allocates the staked PIX to creators to boost their content.
  - Search revenue generated from boosted content is distributed back to your protocol as real yield (in USDC).
  - Your protocol can then distribute this USDC yield to sPIX holders.
```

## Technical Deep Dive

### On-Chain Primitives
```rust
// Simplified representation of our on-chain programs

// Visibility Staking Program
pub mod visibility_staking {
    // Allows users to stake PIX to earn a share of platform revenue
    pub fn stake(ctx: Context<Stake>, amount: u64, duration: i64) -> Result<()> {
        // ... logic to lock PIX and calculate reward multiplier ...
    }
    
    // Distributes USDC earnings to stakers
    pub fn distribute_rewards(ctx: Context<Distribute>) -> Result<()> {
        // ... logic to pull USDC from revenue pool and distribute pro-rata ...
    }
}

// Video NFT Program (using Metaplex Compressed NFTs)
pub mod video_nft {
    // Mints a cNFT representing ownership and revenue rights of a video
    pub fn mint_video_nft(ctx: Context<Mint>, video_id: Uuid) -> Result<()> {
        // ... logic to create a compressed NFT on-chain ...
    }
    
    // Claims revenue for a specific video NFT
    pub fn claim_revenue(ctx: Context<Claim>) -> Result<()> {
        // ... logic to transfer accumulated USDC earnings to the NFT holder ...
    }
}
```

### Composability & Security
- **Audits**: All our on-chain programs are audited by OtterSec and Halborn. Reports are public.
- **Open Source**: Core contracts are open-source for community review.
- **Standard Compliance**: PIX is a standard SPL token. Video NFTs use the Metaplex standard for maximum compatibility.
- **Cross-Program Invocation**: Our programs are designed to be called by other on-chain protocols, enabling seamless integration.

## Common Questions & Answers

**Q: What is the source of the "real yield" for PIX staking?**
A: The yield comes from two primary sources: 1) A portion of the PIX fees creators pay to index their videos. 2) A percentage of the USDC revenue generated when staked videos are discovered through search. This creates a sustainable, non-inflationary yield.

**Q: How do you ensure the security of integrating with your protocol?**
A: All our contracts are audited by top-tier firms. We have an active bug bounty program with Immunefi. We encourage a phased integration approach, starting with conservative risk parameters, and are happy to fund a joint audit for the integration contracts.

**Q: Is your protocol decentralized? What are the risks of centralization?**
A: We are on a path of progressive decentralization. Currently, the team controls certain upgrade parameters for rapid iteration. However, the core payment and staking logic is immutable. We have a clear roadmap to transition to a full DAO governance model over the next 24 months.

**Q: How can we trust the value of the video NFTs?**
A: The value is not speculative; it's based on verifiable on-chain data. Each video NFT has a public history of its earnings from search queries. This transparent cash flow allows for accurate valuation, making them reliable collateral for lending or as a base for financial products.
