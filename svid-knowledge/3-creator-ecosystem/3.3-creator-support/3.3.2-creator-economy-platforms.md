## Integration & Partnership Models

### 1. API Integration & White-Labeling
This is our primary partnership model. You integrate Pixr's functionality directly into your platform, offering it to your users under your own brand.

**How it Works:**
1.  **API Key**: You get a partner API key.
2.  **UI Integration**: You use our SDKs or build your own UI components for:
    -   Uploading videos and investing PIX.
    -   A search bar for creators to search their own content.
    -   An analytics dashboard showing search performance and earnings.
3.  **User Onboarding**: When one of your users decides to use the feature, you create a Pixr account for them via our API.
4.  **Revenue Share**: You earn a percentage of all PIX purchases and/or search revenue generated by the users you onboard.

**Example: "Link-in-Bio" Platform Integration**
-   A creator adds a "Search My Videos" link to their link-in-bio page.
-   Fans can click this link to access a searchable portal of all that creator's content, hosted by Pixr but branded for your platform.
-   The creator manages their indexed videos and tracks earnings directly from your platform's dashboard.

### 2. Referral Partnership
A simpler model where you refer your users to Pixr.

**How it Works:**
1.  **Referral Link**: You get a unique partner referral link.
2.  **Promotion**: You promote Pixr to your user base through email, in-app notifications, blog posts, etc.
3.  **Commission**: You earn a lifetime commission on all PIX purchased by users who sign up through your link.

**Example: Email Marketing Platform**
-   They send an email to their list of creator users: "New Integration Partner: Turn Your Video Content into a Searchable, Income-Generating Asset with Pixr."
-   Creators who click the link and sign up are tagged with the platform's referral code.
-   The email platform earns a 15% commission on all PIX these creators ever purchase.

### 3. Co-Marketing & Content Partnership
We work together to create content and promote each other to our respective audiences.

**Examples:**
-   **Joint Webinars**: "How to Build a Sustainable Creator Business with [Your Platform] and Pixr."
-   **Guest Blog Posts**: We write for your blog about video monetization; you write for ours about audience building.
-   **Social Media Takeovers**: Cross-promotion on Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.

## Common Questions & Answers

**Q: Will this integration confuse our users or pull them away from our platform?**
A: Our goal is the opposite. With a white-label API integration, the feature appears as a native part of your platform. It adds value and gives your creators another reason to stay engaged with your service. You control the user experience.

**Q: What is the technical lift required for an API integration?**
A: It depends on the depth of integration. A basic integration (upload and search) can be completed by a single developer in about a week using our SDKs. We provide comprehensive documentation and dedicated engineering support to our strategic partners to make the process as smooth as possible.

**Q: How does the revenue share model work?**
A: It's flexible. We can offer a percentage of the net revenue from PIX purchases (typically 15-25%) or a share of the search earnings generated by your users. For larger partners, we can negotiate custom models, including licensing fees. All revenue is tracked transparently on our partner dashboard.

**Q: How does this fit with our existing feature set?**
A: Pixr is designed to be complementary. If you help creators build an audience (like an email platform), we help them monetize that audience's engagement. If you provide a central hub for their content (like a link-in-bio service), we make that content more valuable and interactive.
