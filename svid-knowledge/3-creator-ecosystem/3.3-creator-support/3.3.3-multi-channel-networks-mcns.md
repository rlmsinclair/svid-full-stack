## Financial Model: A Hypothetical MCN

**Assumptions:**
-   **MCN Size**: 1,000 channels
-   **Average Videos per Channel**: 200
-   **Total Videos**: 200,000
-   **MCN PIX Investment**: $10 per video ($2M total one-time investment)
-   **Average Searches per Video per Month**: 50
-   **Earnings per Search**: $0.07 (creator/MCN share)
-   **MCN Commission**: 20% of creator earnings

**Revenue Projection (Monthly):**
-   **Total Monthly Searches**: 200,000 videos * 50 searches/video = 10,000,000 searches
-   **Total Monthly Earnings**: 10,000,000 searches * $0.07/search = **$700,000**
-   **MCN's Monthly Commission**: $700,000 * 20% = **$140,000**
-   **Annualized MCN Revenue**: $140,000 * 12 = **$1,680,000**

**ROI**: The MCN's initial $2M investment is paid back in approximately 14 months, after which it becomes a pure, high-margin profit center.

## Common Questions & Answers

**Q: How can we possibly manage PIX investment for thousands of channels?**
A: Our MCN Dashboard is designed for this. You can purchase PIX in bulk (often at a discount) and set automated rules for allocation. For example: "Invest 10M PIX on every video over 10 minutes from a gaming channel" or "Invest 50M PIX on any video that hits 100K views on YouTube." It's designed for scalable, strategic management.

**Q: Does this violate YouTube's Terms of Service?**
A: No. We are not re-hosting or re-distributing the content in a way that violates YouTube's terms. We are creating a new, searchable index of the content that drives traffic and value back to the original creator. We work with creators to ensure they are compliant with all platform policies.

**Q: How do you handle the revenue splits and payments for thousands of creators?**
A: This is a core strength of our platform. You define the revenue split percentage for each creator in your MCN Dashboard. All earnings are calculated and distributed automatically by our smart contracts. You receive your commission instantly, and your creators receive their share instantly. It eliminates the need for complex monthly accounting and manual payouts.

**Q: What's to stop our creators from leaving our MCN and using Pixr directly?**
A: By providing PIX investment as a service, managing their content, and using the network-wide analytics to provide strategic value, you are offering a service they can't get on their own. MCNs that partner with Pixr can offer a unique value proposition that makes their network more attractive to both existing and new talent.
