## Common Questions & Answers

**Q: Is Pixr really free to use? What's the catch?**
A: Yes, it's 100% free for viewers. There's no catch. The platform is funded by the creators themselves, who pay a small fee (using PIX) to make their content searchable. They are investing in their own discoverability, and you get the benefit of a powerful, ad-free search engine.

**Q: How is this different from searching on YouTube?**
A: YouTube search is limited to titles, descriptions, and tags. Pixr search looks *inside* the video content itself. We analyze the audio, the visuals, and any text that appears on screen. This allows you to find specific moments and concepts that would be impossible to find with a traditional search.

**Q: What kind of content can I find on Pixr?**
A: You'll find a growing library of high-quality, information-rich content. Because creators pay to be indexed, the platform naturally favors valuable content like in-depth tutorials, educational lectures, detailed product reviews, and expert discussions.

**Q: Do I need a crypto wallet or need to understand blockchain?**
A: Not at all! As a viewer, the platform works just like any other website. The blockchain technology is used in the background to pay creators instantly, but you don't need to interact with it or understand it to use the service.
