# Discord Moderators

## Audience Profile
Discord Moderators are the volunteer or part-time guardians of our community. They are passionate, highly-engaged users who have a deep understanding of the platform and its culture. They are motivated by a desire to help others, maintain a positive environment, and be a recognized, trusted part of the project. They are our first line of defense, our most active evangelists, and a vital source of user feedback.

## Communication Fundamentals

### Body Language & Presence
- **This is an online, text-based relationship.**
- **Communication Style**: Appreciative, empowering, and clear.
- **Tone**: Treat them as valued team members, not just volunteers.

### Tone & Approach
- **Language**: A mix of casual community slang and clear, official instructions.
- **Pace**: Fast and responsive in private mod channels; thoughtful and strategic in planning discussions.
- **Style**: A supportive leader who provides them with the tools and authority they need to succeed.
- **Focus**: Empowering them to maintain a healthy community and recognizing their valuable contributions.

### Confidence Builders
- A clear set of community guidelines and moderation policies.
- A private, dedicated channel for direct communication with the core team.
- Regular check-ins and "mod-only" meetings to discuss issues and gather feedback.
- Public recognition and appreciation for their work.

## The Moderator's Role & Responsibilities

It's crucial to have a clear, written definition of their role.

```
Moderator Responsibilities:
- **Enforce Community Guidelines**: Gently but firmly enforce the rules in all public channels.
- **Answer User Questions**: Help new users understand how Pixr works, answer common questions, and direct them to the right resources (FAQ, support).
- **Foster Positive Engagement**: Encourage helpful conversations, share exciting content, and lead by example.
- **Identify and Escalate Issues**: Report bugs, technical problems, and serious violations to the core team through the private mod channel.
- **Gather Feedback**: Act as the "ears" of the community, summarizing user sentiment, common feature requests, and pain points for the team.
```

### What a Moderator is NOT:
-   **Not a 24/7 Support Rep**: Mods are volunteers and should not be expected to be available at all times.
-   **Not a Developer**: They should not be expected to solve technical bugs, only report them.
-   **Not a Judge**: For serious disputes or violations, their role is to de-escalate and report, not to pass final judgment.

## Empowering Your Moderators

To be effective, moderators need tools and support from the core team.

1.  **The Moderator Handbook**
    -   A living document that contains:
        -   The official Community Guidelines.
        -   A clear moderation workflow (e.g., "Warning -> Mute -> Kick -> Ban").
        -   Canned responses for common questions and situations.
        -   A guide on when and how to escalate issues to the team.

2.  **Private Communication Channel (`#mods-only`)**
    -   A private Discord channel where mods can communicate with each other and the core team.
    -   Used for escalating issues, asking for clarification on rules, and coordinating actions.
    -   This is the most important tool for building a strong, cohesive mod team.

3.  **Regular "Mod Sync" Meetings**
    -   A bi-weekly or monthly voice chat to discuss recent events, review moderation actions, and gather feedback.
    -   This makes them feel heard and valued, and helps align the team.

4.  **Clear Escalation Path**
    -   A simple process for mods to report serious issues (e.g., using a specific command or tagging a specific team member).
    -   The core team must be responsive to these escalations to maintain trust.

## Common Scenarios & How to Handle Them

**Scenario: A user is spreading FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt) about the price of PIX.**
-   **Mod Action**: Post a calm, factual response pointing to the official tokenomics documentation. State that price speculation is not the focus of the community. If the user persists, issue a warning. If they continue, apply a temporary mute.
-   **Team Backing**: The team should have a clear, public statement on tokenomics that mods can reference.

**Scenario: Two users are in a heated, personal argument.**
-   **Mod Action**: Publicly ask both users to take a step back and communicate respectfully. Use a command to post the community guidelines. DM both users privately to de-escalate. If it continues, apply a temporary mute to both.
-   **Team Backing**: The team must support the mod's decision to mute, even if one of the users is a major PIX holder.

**Scenario: A user discovers a potential exploit or bug.**
-   **Mod Action**: Immediately thank the user publicly for the report. Ask them to DM the details to a specific moderator or team member. Delete the public message to prevent others from attempting the exploit. Escalate to the team in the `#mods-only` channel immediately.
-   **Team Backing**: The engineering team must acknowledge the report quickly and keep the mod team updated on the fix. A bug bounty reward should be considered.
