## Common Scenarios & How to Handle Them

**Scenario: An Ambassador posts content with inaccurate information.**
-   **Action**: Contact them privately and gently. Thank them for creating the content and then say, "Hey, I noticed a small detail that's slightly off. For future reference, [provide correct information]. We've updated the Ambassador Kit with the latest details. Thanks again for spreading the word!" Never correct them publicly.

**Scenario: A competitor tries to poach one of your top Ambassadors.**
-   **Action**: This is a sign your program is working! Reinforce your relationship with the Ambassador. Remind them of the unique value you provide (insider access, direct influence, belief in the mission). Ask them what you can do to better support them. Often, the relationship and belief in the project are stronger than a purely financial offer.

**Scenario: An Ambassador's content is not performing well.**
-   **Action**: Proactively reach out to offer support. Say, "Hey, I've been looking at your recent content and had a few ideas on how we could boost its reach. Would you be open to a quick brainstorming session?" Offer to collaborate on a piece or provide them with some insider info for their next video.
