# Data Privacy Officers (GDPR/CCPA)

## Audience Profile
Data Privacy Officers (DPOs) and privacy professionals are the guardians of user data and regulatory compliance. Their primary responsibility is to ensure the company adheres to complex data protection regulations like the GDPR in Europe and the CCPA/CPRA in California. They are detail-oriented, process-driven, and focused on minimizing risk. They think in terms of data lifecycle management, user consent, data subject rights, and privacy by design.

### 1. Lawful Basis for Processing
-   **Our Position**: We process user data on several lawful bases under GDPR Article 6:
    1.  **Consent (Art. 6(1)(a))**: For non-essential activities like marketing emails, we obtain explicit, opt-in consent.
    2.  **Contract (Art. 6(1)(b))**: Most of our data processing is necessary to provide the service the user has signed up for. For example, we must process their video content to make it searchable, and we must process their wallet information to pay them. This is covered by our Terms of Service.
    3.  **Legitimate Interest (Art. 6(1)(f))**: For activities like fraud prevention, security monitoring, and internal analytics to improve the service, we rely on legitimate interest. We have conducted a Legitimate Interests Assessment (LIA) to ensure our interests are balanced against the rights of the user.

### 2. Data Subject Rights
-   **Our Commitment**: "We have built systems to ensure users can easily exercise their rights under GDPR and CCPA."
-   **Our Processes**:
    -   **Right to Access (DSAR)**: "Users can request a complete export of their data through their account settings. This process is automated and provides a machine-readable (JSON) file containing their profile information, uploaded content metadata, and transaction history."
    -   **Right to Rectification**: "Users can edit their profile information directly in their account settings at any time."
    -   **Right to Erasure ('Right to be Forgotten')**: "Users can delete their account, which triggers a process to permanently delete their personal data and anonymize their non-personal data (e.g., aggregated analytics) from our systems within 30 days."
    -   **Right to Data Portability**: "The DSAR export is provided in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format to ensure portability."
    -   **Right to Object/Restrict Processing**: "Users can opt-out of marketing communications and non-essential cookie usage through their privacy settings."

### 3. Privacy by Design & Default
-   **Our Philosophy**: "We built Pixr with privacy as a core principle, not an afterthought."
-   **Examples**:
    -   **Data Minimization**: "We only collect the data absolutely necessary to provide the service. For example, we do not require real names for account creation."
    -   **Privacy Settings**: "The default visibility for uploaded videos is 'Private.' Users must proactively choose to make their content public or unlisted."
    -   **Pseudonymization**: "User activity is tracked against a pseudonymous user ID (UUID) in our analytics systems, decoupling it from their personal email address where possible."
    -   **On-Chain Privacy**: "While payment transactions are public on the Solana blockchain, we do not link our users' platform identities to their wallet addresses in any public way. We use a system of derived, per-user deposit addresses to enhance privacy."

### 4. Data Transfers & Third-Party Processors
-   **Our Sub-processors**: "We maintain a public list of all third-party data sub-processors we use (e.g., AWS for hosting, Stripe for payments, OpenAI for AI analysis)."
-   **International Transfers**: "For data transfers outside the EU/UK, we rely on Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) and have conducted Transfer Impact Assessments (TIAs) to ensure data is adequately protected. Our primary infrastructure is hosted in AWS regions within the EU."
-   **Vendor Due Diligence**: "All our vendors go through a security and privacy review to ensure they meet our data protection standards."

## Common Questions & Answers

**Q: Your AI analyzes user content. How do you ensure the privacy of that content?**
A: This is a critical point. For our AI analysis:
1.  **Data in Transit**: All content is encrypted (TLS 1.3) when sent to our AI partners (like OpenAI).
2.  **Data at Rest**: The content is processed in memory and is not stored by the AI provider long-term.
3.  **Contractual Agreements**: Our Data Processing Agreements (DPAs) with AI vendors explicitly forbid them from using our users' content to train their models.
4.  **On-Premise Option**: For our enterprise clients, we offer a private cloud or on-premise deployment where their content never leaves their own secure environment.

**Q: How do you handle user data on the public Solana blockchain?**
A: We are very careful about this. We do not store any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) on-chain. User earnings are sent to their wallet address, but we do not publicly link that wallet address to their Pixr username. The transaction is public, but the identity behind the wallet address is not, unless the user chooses to reveal it.

**Q: What is your data retention policy?**
A: Our data retention policy is outlined in our Privacy Policy. In summary:
-   **User Account Data**: Retained as long as the account is active. Deleted within 30 days of an account deletion request.
-   **Uploaded Content**: Managed by the user. Deleted immediately upon user deletion.
-   **Analytics Data**: Anonymized and aggregated data may be retained indefinitely for statistical purposes.
-   **Financial Records**: Retained for the period required by law (typically 7 years).

**Q: How do you handle a data breach?**
A: We have a comprehensive Incident Response Plan. In the event of a data breach involving personal data, we are prepared to notify the relevant supervisory authority (like the UK's ICO) within 72 hours and to notify the affected individuals without undue delay if the breach is likely to result in a high risk to their rights and freedoms.
