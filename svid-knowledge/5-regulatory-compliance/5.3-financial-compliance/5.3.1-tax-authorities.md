## Key Taxable Events on the Pixr Platform

It is crucial to clearly define the events that may trigger a tax liability for our users and for the company itself.

### For Creators & Investors (Users)
1.  **Earnings from Search (Income)**
    -   **Event**: A creator or investor receives USDC from the earnings pool when their content is viewed via search.
    -   **Tax Treatment**: This is treated as **income**. The fair market value of the USDC at the time it is received is taxable as ordinary income.
    -   **Our Role**: We provide users with a detailed transaction history, showing the date, time, and USDC amount for every earning event. We will issue appropriate tax forms (e.g., 1099-MISC in the US for earnings over $600) to our users as required by law.

2.  **Sale or Exchange of PIX (Capital Gains/Losses)**
    -   **Event**: A user sells PIX on a crypto exchange for fiat currency (e.g., USD, GBP) or another cryptocurrency.
    -   **Tax Treatment**: This is a **capital gains** event. The user must calculate the difference between the sale price and their cost basis (the price at which they acquired the PIX).
    -   **Our Role**: While we do not facilitate these sales directly, we provide a complete history of PIX acquisitions (purchases, earnings) to help users determine their cost basis.

3.  **Spending PIX on Indexing (Business Expense/Capital Loss)**
    -   **Event**: A creator spends PIX to index a video.
    -   **Tax Treatment**: This is a complex area that depends on jurisdiction and how the creator's activity is classified (hobby vs. business).
        -   If the creator is operating as a **business**, the cost of the PIX spent may be deductible as a business expense (e.g., marketing or advertising).
        -   If treated as a capital asset, spending the PIX is a disposal, which could trigger a capital gain or loss.
    -   **Our Role**: We provide a clear record of all PIX spent, including the date, amount, and the USD value at the time of the transaction. We advise users to consult with a tax professional to determine the correct treatment.

### For SVID AI (The Company)
1.  **Revenue from PIX Sales**
    -   **Event**: The company sells PIX to users for fiat currency or cryptocurrency.
    -   **Tax Treatment**: This is treated as **corporate revenue** and is subject to corporation tax.

2.  **Revenue from Premium Subscriptions**
    -   **Event**: Users pay a recurring fee for Pixr Pro or Pixr Business.
    -   **Tax Treatment**: This is standard subscription revenue, subject to corporation tax and potentially VAT/sales tax.

3.  **Value Added Tax (VAT) / Sales Tax**
    -   **Event**: Sale of digital services (PIX, subscriptions) to users.
    -   **Tax Treatment**: We are responsible for collecting and remitting VAT/sales tax in jurisdictions where we meet the requirements for digital services.
    -   **Our Role**: Our billing system is designed to identify the user's location and apply the correct tax rate at the point of sale.

## Our Compliance & Reporting Systems

Demonstrating robust systems is key to building trust with tax authorities.

-   **Transaction Ledger**: "Our database maintains an immutable, time-stamped ledger of every single transaction on the platform, including PIX purchases, PIX spending, and USDC earnings distributions."
-   **User Tax Center**: "Within their account settings, every user has access to a 'Tax Center' where they can:
    -   Download a complete CSV history of all their transactions.
    -   Generate an annual summary of their earnings (income) and PIX expenditures (potential expenses).
    -   Access copies of any official tax forms we have issued to them (e.g., 1099s)."
-   **KYC/AML Integration**: "We perform Know Your Customer (KYC) checks on users who exceed certain transaction or earnings thresholds, as required by Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations. This ensures we can comply with reporting requirements."
-   **Geo-IP and Billing Address Collection**: "Our payment system collects location data to ensure we correctly apply and remit VAT/sales tax for digital services according to international regulations."

## Common Questions & Answers

**Q: How do you determine the fair market value of PIX and USDC for tax reporting purposes?**
A:
-   **USDC**: As a stablecoin pegged 1:1 with the US dollar, its fair market value is consistently $1.00.
-   **PIX**: For transactions where PIX is exchanged (e.g., a creator spending it), we record the USD equivalent value at that precise moment. We use a volume-weighted average price (VWAP) from major exchanges where PIX is listed to determine this value.

**Q: Are you required to report user transactions to tax authorities?**
A: We are committed to complying with all legal reporting requirements in the jurisdictions where we operate. For example, under current US law, we are required to issue a Form 1099-MISC to any US-based user who earns over $600 in a calendar year. We have systems in place to collect the necessary information (e.g., W-9 forms) and file these forms with the IRS and the user. We will adapt our reporting as regulations evolve.

**Q: How do you handle cross-border transactions and the potential for tax avoidance?**
A: We take our cross-border obligations seriously. Our KYC process helps us identify the tax residency of our users. We apply tax rules (like VAT) based on the user's location. We cooperate fully with lawful requests for information from tax authorities in accordance with international tax treaties and agreements.
