# Technical Advisors

## Audience Profile
Technical Advisors are seasoned experts, often former CTOs, principal engineers, or renowned academics. They are not involved in the day-to-day execution but provide high-level strategic guidance on technology, architecture, and long-term technical vision. They are motivated by solving interesting, hard problems and by the intellectual challenge of guiding a promising company. They value deep technical discussions, long-term thinking, and a clear-eyed view of technical trade-offs.

## Communication Fundamentals

### Body Language & Presence
- **Setting**: Advisory board meetings, one-on-one deep dive sessions.
- **Posture**: A humble and curious student. You are there to learn from their experience.
- **Gestures**: Whiteboarding is key. Visually map out architectural challenges.
- **Eye Contact**: Attentive and respectful.

### Tone & Approach
- **Language**: Highly technical and abstract. This is the one audience where you should not simplify technical concepts.
- **Pace**: Deep and exploratory. These are not quick status updates.
- **Style**: A promising founder seeking the wisdom of an experienced mentor.
- **Focus**: The most difficult, long-term technical challenges and strategic architectural decisions.

### Confidence Builders
- Come prepared with specific, well-defined problems to discuss.
- Demonstrate that you have thought deeply about the problem yourself and have already considered several potential solutions.
- Be completely transparent about your technical challenges and weaknesses.
- Show that you have acted on their previous advice.

## Key Topics for Advisory Sessions

Your time with advisors is precious. Come prepared with your most strategic and difficult questions.

### 1. Long-Term Architectural Decisions
This is where advisors can provide the most value, helping you avoid costly long-term mistakes.

-   **The Question**: "We are currently a modular monolith. As we scale, we are considering a move to a microservices architecture. Given our specific challenges with real-time video processing and blockchain integration, what are the key pitfalls we should be aware of? What would you recommend as our 'seams' for the first services to break out?"
-   **The Question**: "Our database is currently PostgreSQL. We are seeing heavy load on our vector search queries. Should we move to a dedicated vector database like Pinecone, or should we double down on scaling Postgres with extensions like pgvector? What are the long-term trade-offs?"
-   **The Question**: "We are building on Solana for its performance, but we are concerned about long-term decentralization and ecosystem risk. What would a multi-chain strategy look like for us? Should we be building an abstraction layer now, and what would that entail?"

### 2. Scaling and Performance Bottlenecks
Present them with your performance data and ask for their insights on future bottlenecks.

-   **The Question**: "Here is our current system performance dashboard. Our p95 latency for API calls is 50ms. Our video processing pipeline takes 3 minutes for a 10-minute 4K video. These numbers are good now, but where do you predict the system will break when we are at 100x our current scale? What should we be investing in *now* to prevent that?"
-   **The Question**: "Our GPU cluster is our biggest infrastructure cost. We are currently using a custom scheduler on top of Kubernetes. Are there more efficient orchestration strategies we should be considering? How would you approach optimizing for cost vs. processing speed at massive scale?"

### 3. Technology Choices & Future-Proofing
Get their perspective on major technology bets.

-   **The Question**: "We are considering building our own in-house AI models for video analysis to reduce our reliance on OpenAI and improve our domain-specific accuracy. Given the current pace of AI development, is this a wise strategic investment, or should we continue to build on top of foundational models?"
-   **The Question**: "The Temporal workflow engine was removed from our stack to simplify our immediate architecture. Was this a short-sighted decision? What are the long-term risks of relying on our current, simpler queueing system as our processing logic becomes more complex?"
-   **The Question**: "We are seeing the rise of new technologies like [e.g., Firedancer for Solana, new AI models]. Which of these do you see as a potential existential threat or a massive opportunity for us? Where should we be placing our 'research bets'?"

### 4. Engineering Team & Culture
Leverage their experience in building and scaling world-class engineering teams.

-   **The Question**: "This is our current engineering team structure. As we scale from 20 to 100 engineers, what is the single biggest mistake that founders make in evolving their team structure and culture? How do we maintain our speed and agility as we grow?"
-   **The Question**: "How would you assess the current skill set of our team? Where are our biggest gaps, and what key roles should we be prioritizing in our hiring plan for the next 12 months?"

## How to Get the Most Out of Your Advisors

-   **Prepare a Detailed Briefing Doc**: Before each meeting, send a concise (2-3 page) document outlining the key challenges and questions you want to discuss. Include relevant data, diagrams, and your own current thinking.
-   **Don't Ask for Answers, Ask for Frameworks**: Instead of "Should we use X or Y?", ask "How would you approach the decision between X and Y? What framework would you use to evaluate this?"
-   **Be Vulnerable**: Be honest about what you don't know. Advisors are most helpful when they know the real problems.
-   **Follow Up**: After the meeting, send a summary of the key takeaways and the actions you plan to take based on their advice. In the next meeting, start by showing them the results of those actions. This shows you value their time and expertise.

## Call-to-Action

### For Recruiting a New Advisor
"I'm the founder of Pixr, and we're solving some incredibly difficult problems at the intersection of AI, video, and decentralized systems. Your work on [mention their specific area of expertise] is legendary, and your perspective on how to scale our [specific technical challenge] would be invaluable. I would be honored if you would consider joining us as a technical advisor."

### For an Advisory Board Meeting
"This quarter, our biggest strategic question is [the key technical challenge]. We've prepared a briefing document with our current data and three potential architectural paths forward. We would love to spend the majority of our session getting your unfiltered feedback and guidance on this decision, as it will have a major impact on our trajectory for the next three years."

## Quick Reference

### Elevator Pitch (for a potential advisor)
"Pixr is building a high-performance, decentralized platform for AI-powered video search. We're facing fascinating challenges in large-scale distributed systems, real-time data processing, and applied AI. We're looking for expert advisors to help us make the right long-term architectural decisions as we scale."

### Good Questions to Ask
-   "What are we not thinking about?"
-   "What is the biggest technical risk you see in our current approach?"
-   "If you were in my shoes, what would be keeping you up at night about our tech stack?"
-   "Which of our current technical assumptions do you think is most likely to be wrong?"

### Bad Questions to Ask
-   "Do you like our product?" (Too general)
-   "Should we use React or Vue?" (Too tactical)
-   "Can you introduce me to investors?" (Not their primary role)

Remember: Technical advisors are a strategic resource for your most difficult, long-term technical decisions. Don't waste their time with day-to-day issues. Come prepared with your hardest problems, be open to being challenged, and focus on learning from their decades of experience. Their guidance can help you avoid costly mistakes and build a system that will stand the test of time.
