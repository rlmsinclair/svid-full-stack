# Business Advisors

## Audience Profile
Business Advisors are experienced executives, successful entrepreneurs, and industry veterans. They provide strategic guidance on business models, go-to-market strategy, fundraising, and organizational scaling. They are less concerned with the technical details and more with the market, the competition, and the overall health of the business. They are motivated by helping a promising company navigate the complex path to market leadership.

## Key Topics for Advisory Sessions

Come to your business advisors with your biggest "company-building" challenges.

### 1. Go-to-Market (GTM) Strategy
This is about how you will reach and win your target market.

-   **The Question**: "We have strong initial traction with independent course creators (product-led growth). Now, we need to move upmarket to enterprise clients. Should we build a dedicated outbound sales team, or should we focus on a product-led GTM strategy where teams adopt us organically? What are the trade-offs, and what organizational changes would each path require?"
-   **The Question**: "Our primary user acquisition is currently organic and viral. This is great for our CAC, but it's not predictable. What would be the first, most scalable paid acquisition channel you would experiment with, and how would you structure that experiment?"
-   **The Question**: "We are considering international expansion into the European market. Should our initial entry be focused on the UK, or should we take a broader approach? What are the key operational and product localization steps we need to take before we enter that market?"

### 2. Business Model & Pricing
This is about how you capture the value you create.

-   **The Question**: "Our current revenue is primarily from PIX sales. We are considering launching a premium subscription (Pixr Pro) for our power users. How should we think about balancing these two revenue streams? Is there a risk that the subscription model will cannibalize PIX sales?"
-   **The Question**: "Here is our current pricing model. Are we leaving money on the table? How would you approach a pricing experiment to test for elasticity and find the optimal price point for our different user segments?"
-   **The Question**: "We are exploring a revenue-sharing model with our API partners. What is a standard and competitive revenue share percentage for this type of partnership in the current market?"

### 3. Competitive Strategy & Moat-Building
This is about how you will win and build a durable, long-term business.

-   **The Question**: "This is our current competitive landscape. Who do you see as our biggest existential threat in the next 2-3 years? Is it a direct competitor, or is it a tech giant like Google or Adobe entering our space? How can we build a defensible 'moat' around our business?"
-   **The Question**: "Our first-mover advantage is our key strength right now. How do we best press that advantage? Should we focus on rapid user acquisition at all costs, or should we focus on deepening our product's network effects and switching costs for our existing users?"

### 4. Fundraising & Corporate Development
This is about capitalizing the business for growth.

-   **The Question**: "Here are our financial projections for the next 24 months. Based on these, when is the optimal time for us to raise our Series B? What key metrics do we need to hit to command a top-tier valuation?"
-   **The Question**: "We have been approached by [Large Company X] about a potential acquisition. We are not actively looking to sell, but the offer is significant. How would you frame the decision-making process for evaluating this offer versus continuing to build independently?"

## How to Get the Most Out of Your Advisors

-   **The "One-Pager"**: Before each meeting, send a one-page memo.
    -   **Section 1: State of the Business**: A dashboard of your 5-7 key metrics (e.g., MRR, user growth, churn, runway) and how they've trended since your last meeting.
    -   **Section 2: Key Progress**: A bulleted list of your most important accomplishments since the last meeting.
    -   **Section 3: The Big Question**: Clearly and concisely state the single most important strategic question you want their advice on during the meeting.
-   **Be Honest About Your Challenges**: Don't just present a rosy picture. The best advisors do their best work when they know the real problems you're facing.
-   **Ask "Who" not just "What"**: Good advisors have incredible networks. Instead of just asking for advice, ask for introductions. "We're planning to hire a VP of Sales next year. Who are the three best sales leaders you've ever worked with?"

## Call-to-Action

### For Recruiting a New Advisor
"I'm the founder of Pixr, and we're building a new economic model for the $200B creator economy. We have strong product-market fit and are growing 73% month-over-month, but we are now facing the key strategic challenges of scaling our GTM and building a durable competitive moat. Your experience in scaling [their specific area of expertise, e.g., 'B2B SaaS companies'] would be absolutely invaluable as we navigate this next phase of growth. I would be honored if you would consider joining us as a business advisor."

### For an Advisory Board Meeting
"The agenda for our meeting today is focused on one key question: 'What is our primary growth engine for the next 18 months?' I've prepared a one-pager with our current metrics and three potential strategic paths. I'm looking for your unfiltered guidance on which path you believe will create the most long-term value."

## Quick Reference

### Elevator Pitch (for a potential advisor)
"Pixr has found strong product-market fit and is growing organically at 73% MoM. We are now at a strategic inflection point where we need to build a scalable go-to-market machine and a durable competitive moat. We are looking for experienced operators to advise us as we scale from a product to a company."

### Good Questions to Ask
-   "What would you do if you were in my position?"
-   "What is the biggest mistake you see companies at our stage make?"
-   "What are the one or two metrics we should be absolutely obsessed with right now?"
-   "Who is the best person you know in [a specific function, e.g., enterprise sales]?"

### Bad Questions to Ask
-   "What do you think of our new feature?" (Too tactical)
-   "Can you help us with this operational issue?" (Too in-the-weeds)
-   "Do you think we'll be successful?" (Too general)

Remember: Business advisors are there to help you with the big picture. They've seen the movie before and can help you avoid common plot twists. Use their time wisely by focusing on your most critical, company-defining strategic decisions. Respect their experience, come prepared, and be open to having your assumptions challenged.
