## How to Work Effectively with Legal Advisors

-   **Involve Them Early**: Don't bring in legal at the last minute to "bless" a deal. Involve them in the early stages of product design and strategic planning to proactively identify and mitigate risks.
-   **Provide Full Context**: Give them all the relevant information, not just the parts you think are important. The "why" behind a business decision is as important as the "what."
-   **Ask for Options, Not Just "Yes/No"**: Instead of "Can we do this?", ask "We want to achieve X. What are the different legal paths we could take to get there, and what are the relative risks of each?"
-   **Respect Their Counsel**: You are the ultimate decision-maker, but if you choose to go against your legal advice, do so with a full understanding of the risks you are accepting.
